## Grafana2Whatsapp
This code was made to receive a webhook from grafana and send a post to
whatsapp api to notify in a group chat.
This works for my homelab but if you want to use, you have to setup [this](https://github.com/chrishubert/whatsapp-web-api.git) and use grafana contact point as webhook to it.
